This module is inspired by [GraphQL Modules](https://graphql-modules.com) by [@UriGoldshtein](https://twitter.com/UriGoldshtein). It uses [Pulumi](https://pulumi.com) (*Modern Infrastructure as Code* tool) to deploy modulized GraphQL APIs to [AWS AppSync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm i pulumi-appsync-modules
```

or

```bash
$ yarn add pulumi-appsync-modules
```

## Motivation

We love [Separation of Concerns](https://deviq.com/separation-of-concerns/) design, and we like where [GraphQL Modules](https://graphql-modules.com) are going. We use AWS for different projects, so we have a few larger projects under our belt with AWS Appsync. We tought there would be an excellent match to build something similar to GraphQL Modules ‚Äì but for AWS Appsync. Our goal was to build something that looked similar in design (having the same API was vital). Using Pulumi made the most sense because we could keep our library lightweight.
